# Project Overview: Enhanced Hotel Data Collection

## What We Want to Achieve

Currently, Love Holidays collects hotel availability and pricing data at a monthly aggregated level. We want to enhance this to collect data at the daily departure date level with additional dimensions.

## Data Granularity Improvement

### Current State
- **Date Level**: Monthly aggregation only (e.g., "March 2025")
- **Duration**: Fixed 7-night packages
- **Party Composition**: 2 adults only 
- **Board Basis**: Basic pricing without meal plan breakdown

### Target State  
- **Date Level**: Specific departure dates (e.g., "March 15, 2025")
- **Duration**: Multiple options (2, 3, 5, 7 nights)
- **Party Composition**: Couples (2+0) and families (2+1)
- **Board Basis**: Separate data for Room Only, Bed & Breakfast, Half Board, All Inclusive

## Business Value

### Improved Decision Making
- See pricing patterns for specific dates instead of monthly averages
- Identify weekend vs weeknight pricing differences
- Understand short-stay vs long-stay demand patterns

### Customer Segmentation
- Analyze couples vs families booking behavior
- Target different party compositions with appropriate offers
- Optimize pricing for different customer segments

### Revenue Optimization
- Maximize board basis upselling opportunities
- Price different meal plans competitively
- Adjust pricing based on daily demand patterns

## Expected Outcomes

- More precise pricing strategies based on daily patterns
- Better inventory management for different duration stays
- Improved customer targeting based on party composition
- Enhanced meal plan revenue through board basis insights

## Implementation Dependencies

The data pipeline infrastructure is ready to process this enhanced data. However, the underlying hotel search APIs currently provide only monthly aggregated data and need enhancement to support:

1. Daily departure date granularity
2. Multiple duration options per request
3. Different party compositions
4. Board basis breakdowns in responses
